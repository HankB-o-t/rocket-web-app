# Web app made using rust
This is my own personal web app using rocket.rs in rust

It uses:
- Routing from rocket
- Handlebars
- Rust (Obviously)

## USING
If you want to use this, give credit if you aren't going to fork this, by forking you are giving credit, so I'll appreciate that


## Requirements
- Rust (Latest version)
- Cargo (probably included with rust)

To install dependencies you only need to do ´cargo run´ or ´cargo watch -x run´ (for executing when save)
